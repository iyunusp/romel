# arcane_rune/main.py Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the `main.py` script, which calculates the cost of leveling up arcane runes in a game, or determines the maximum level achievable with a given amount of resources.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The script requires a data file named `detail_cost.txt` located in a `data` subdirectory. This file should contain the cost information for each rune level in the format:

  ```
  Level 1: 10 Radiant Crystals, 1000 Zeny
  Level 2: 15 Radiant Crystals, 1500 Zeny
  ...
  ```

## Running the Script

The script is executed from the command line with various arguments to specify the calculation mode and parameters.

```bash
python main.py -m <mode> [options]
```

## Available Arguments

The script uses `argparse` for command-line argument parsing. Here's a breakdown of the available arguments:

### Required Arguments

- `-m`, `--mode`:  Specifies the calculation mode.  Must be either `cost` or `invest`.
    - `cost`: Calculates the total cost (Radiant Crystals and Zeny) to level up runes from a starting level to an ending level.
    - `invest`: Determines the maximum rune level achievable with a given amount of Radiant Crystals, starting from a specific level.

### Optional Arguments

- `-s`, `--start`: The starting level for the calculation. Defaults to 1.  Must be an integer between 1 and the maximum level defined in `detail_cost.txt`.
- `-e`, `--end`: The ending level for the calculation (used with `cost` mode). Defaults to the maximum level defined in `detail_cost.txt`. Must be an integer between 1 and the maximum level.
- `-r`, `--radiant`: The amount of Radiant Crystals available (used with `invest` mode). Defaults to 0.

## Examples

1. **Calculate the cost to level up from level 10 to 20:**

   ```bash
   python main.py -m cost -s 10 -e 20
   ```

2. **Calculate the cost to level up from level 1 to the maximum level (assuming it's 50):**

   ```bash
   python main.py -m cost
   ```

3. **Determine the maximum level achievable from level 5 with 1000 Radiant Crystals:**

   ```bash
   python main.py -m invest -s 5 -r 1000
   ```

## Output

The script will print the results of the calculation to the console. The output format depends on the chosen mode:

- **`cost` mode:**  Prints the total Radiant Crystals and Zeny required to level up from the start level to the end level.
- **`invest` mode:** Prints the maximum level achievable with the given Radiant Crystals, the total Radiant Crystals spent, and the total Zeny spent.

If an error occurs (e.g., invalid level range, missing cost data), an error message will be printed.

## Notes

- The maximum level is determined dynamically based on the data in `detail_cost.txt`.
- Ensure that `detail_cost.txt` accurately reflects the cost information for your game or application.
- The script uses regular expressions to parse the cost data from `detail_cost.txt`. If the file format changes, the regular expressions in the script may need to be updated.
